## nullish coalescing operator (??) | nullish 병합 연산자(nullish coalescing operator) (#⭐⭐⭐배운 것)

```
To handle this situation, you can use the nullish coalescing operator (??) to provide a default value for isPinnedCount when it is undefined. The operator checks if the value on the left-hand side is null or undefined, and if so, it returns the value on the right-hand side.
```

```jsx
/* In this example, if isPinnedCount is undefined, the value of pinnedCount will be set to 0. Otherwise, if isPinnedCount has a value, that value will be assigned to pinnedCount. */

const pinnedCount = isPinnedCount ?? 0;
```
