# S: Single-responsibility principle (단일 책임 원칙)

## **Description**
This principle states that every method/class should handle a single responsibility. This is important because it results in better readability of code and separation of concerns.


### The Challenge
Suppose in a particular API, we wish to fetch posts, clean up some data, and then send back a response. Here’s some fairly easy-to-use code that should serve our purposes:

```typescript
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const getPosts = async (userId: number) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}/posts`
    );
    const posts = await response.json();
    // Do some cleanup; remove UserID from post since it's not really needed
    const cleanedPosts = posts.map((post) => {
      delete post["userId"];
      return post;
    });
    return cleanedPosts;
  } catch (e) {
    // Log error in some kind of Error Logging Service, here we just do console log
    console.log(e);
    // Send a meaningful but non-technical error message back to the end-user
    throw Error("Error while fetching Posts!");
  }
};

const main = async () => {
  const result = await getPosts(1);
  console.log(result);
};

main();
```


### **Where this fails**

This approach works but has a few issues that become pretty substantial when working with larger codebases.

1. The function handles too many things — fetching data, error handling, and even cleaning up posts.
2. It is difficult to re-use — again the tight coupling is an issue.

### **Solution**

The above code can be made cleaner and simpler by enforcing the Single Responsibility Principle. This can be done in two steps:

1. Taking the error handling code out of the main function — the error handling part can be generic and common to every other function.
2. Extracting the `cleanupPosts` to a new function since isn’t really a responsibility for `fetchPosts`.

```ts
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const fetchPosts = async (userId: number) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}/posts`
    );
    return await response.json();
  } catch (e) {
    handleError(e, "Error while fetching Posts!");
  }
};

const handleError = (e, message) => {
  // Log error in some kind of Error Logging Service, here we just do console log
  console.log(e);
  // Send a generic Error message back to the user
  throw Error(message);
};

const cleanupPosts = (posts) => {
  // Do some cleanup; remove UserID from post since it's not really needed
  return posts.map((post) => {
    delete post["userId"];
    return post;
  });
};

const main = async () => {
  const posts = await fetchPosts(1);
  console.log(cleanupPosts(posts));
};
```


### naming 을 명확하게 할 수 있는 단위

- naming을 명확하게 할 수 있는 단위
    - method naming
        - 동사 + 명사
```


### 제대로 관심사 분리(역할 배분)을 하면, test coverage 를 확보할 수 있음  
```
- test coverage
    - 100%
    - if / else
    - if → 제대로 동작하나 확인
    - else → 동작 확인
- test coverage

function a: if / elif / else → 3가지

function b: if / elif / else → 3가지

6가지
```

# **Summary**

The Single Responsibility Principle is the easiest to understand, digest and follow of all the SOLID principles. In case you need a trigger to keep up with it, just keep in mind that **a class/module should have only 1 reason to change**.
